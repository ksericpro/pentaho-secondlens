## Pentaho Partner Workshop

![Audience](https://jporeilly.github.io/Pentaho-Training/assets/img/secondhand_lens.png)
  Secondhand Lens (SL) have a number of Camera stores throughout the United Kingdom and United States, which primarily sell secondhand camera lenses. Along with their store sales, they also have a website which customers can purchase these lenses online.

  Up to now, SL’s business analysts and management team had to reach out to the I.T operations team to run queries on the transactional database to generate basic reports. Data Analysts need to be empowered to 'slice and dice' the data on an ad-hoc basis, i.e. by time, geography, or lens type. Managers wish to updated in a timely manner with operational and financial reports. 

  A new approach is required to access their data, and Pentaho Analytics Suite is a perfect solution. The company has provided the following high-level requirements:

  * Users login to a portal and execute / create reports.
  * Data Analysts require an OLAP solution, so they can measure their sales:
      - By sales channel
      - By store
      - By time
      - By city
      - By product
  * Business needs an ad hoc way to generate reports on transaction details.
  * End of month reports should be generated as pdf to be distributed to the management team for monthly strategic meetings, and investors.
  * Sales Manager would like to have a high-level view of the overall sales.

#### Phase I
  * SL can use any security scheme that comes with the product, but all users must have accounts with proper roles and permissions. For future phases,     the platform needs to be integrated with Active Directory.
  * SL’s IT environment, has a development and a production environment.  Code or artifacts need to be promoted from a source control repository.
  * The platform will not have direct network access to the production database. Data file extracts can be placed in any location for the platform to      process them.
  * The data files are extracted several times during day to keep the reporting data as up to date as possible.
  * Development and production environments are on virtual servers running Ubuntu Linux.

#### Phase II
  * SL would like to extend the application to support reports for store managers such that they can only see the performance of their own stores.
  * SL is in the process of implementing a portal for their employees, store personnel and customers which goes live next year. They would like to         know how they can leverage the Pentaho platform for reporting and analytics within their web application.
